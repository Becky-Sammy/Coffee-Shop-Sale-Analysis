### Finding

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- Maven Roasters sales has increased over the months from February, between Feb. and May there was more than 20% sales increase and May to June 6% increase
- Monday, Thurday and Friday are the busiest days of the week
- Barista Expresso drive the most revenue for the business
 
### Recommendations

The analysis shows company steady growth over the months however i suggest;
- Keep low supply of packaged chocolate, branded, loose tea and coffee beans as this is the least moving items in shop across the 3 location
- Review the operating hours to help in reducing the operating cost, especially in Lower Manhattan (from 7 p.m - 8p.m there very few orders)
